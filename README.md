<h1>Data Science and Machine Learning with Python</h1>

<p>Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning repository! This folder is dedicated to my journey in Data Science and Machine Learning, leveraging Python to explore concepts, develop models, and solve data-driven problems.</p>

<h2>About this Repository</h2>

<p>This repository contains various projects, scripts, and notebooks that cover a range of topics within Data Science and Machine Learning, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Exploration, visualization, and preprocessing techniques for data.</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning Models</strong>: Implementations of common algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, clustering) from scratch and using libraries like <code>scikit-learn</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: Experiments with neural networks using frameworks such as <code>TensorFlow</code> and <code>PyTorch</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-World Projects</strong>: Applications to demonstrate end-to-end model development and deployment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Folder Structure</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Notebooks</strong>: Interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on experimentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Scripts</strong>: Standalone Python scripts for reusable code.</li>
  <li><strong>Datasets</strong>: Sample datasets used in various projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with the code, clone this repository and ensure you have Python and relevant packages installed. Check the requirements for each project to set up the appropriate environment.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>This repository is both a learning resource and a portfolio of my work. Contributions, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome!</p>
